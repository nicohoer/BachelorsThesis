# "Comparative study of the predictive quality of random forest and gradient boosted tree models in the prediction of diabetes disease"
This repository contains the code I developed for my Bachelor's thesis, where I conducted a comparative study of Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Tree models in predicting diabetes. I've written this thesis at the Chair of Statistics and Data Science at the 
University of Augsburg from July to October in 2023 and received a grade of <b>2.0</b>. The dataset I used was from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). The purpose of uploading this project is to showcase my skills in data science and machine learning using Python.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of two machine learning models—Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees—for diabetes prediction. This analysis involved:

* Data Preprocessing: Preparing the dataset by handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling to improve model performance.
* Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features that enhance the predictive power of the models.
* Model Training: Implementing and training Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Tree models using scikit-learn.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to identify the most effective approach.
* Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib to show key insights and model performance.
## Technologies I used
* Python
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
## Structure
The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step breakdown of the entire workflow (in German!), from data preprocessing to model evaluation, and includes code annotations for clarity.

Feel free to explore the code!
